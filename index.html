  <p><img src="images/squash.jpg" alt="squash">Gardening of all types is a great pastime that allows us to become closer to nature and helps teach us to become good wards of our environment. It allows us to escape the confines our our day today routine and allows us to relax and gives us an outlet to relieve the stress in our day to day lives.

  <p><strong>Flower Gardens</strong></p>

<p>Flower gardens can really do wonders for a home. Before you plant your flower gardens, you should sketch your garden layout so that you have a good visualization of what your flower beds and flower borders are going to look like. A well planned and organized garden really adds value to a home. A poorly laid out garden looks messy and will cause much frustration and disappointment down the road. </p>
<p><strong>Proper care</strong></p>

<p>Even after the planning and actual planting of your garden are completed, there is still plenty of work to be done. Lawns and borders require regular watering and fertilization to keep them health. Also pests must be contained or controlled by some method. Whether you use commercial pesticides or organic methods is strictly up to you. Weeding is a time consuming task and requires constant vigilance to keep the invaders under control. Many plants have to be re-planted yearly unless you choose to plant perennials which grow each season without having to be replanted. Replenishing or replacing the soil helps keep parasites from building up in the soil and also replenishes organic matter that is a necessity for healthy plant root systems. </p>
<p><strong>Fall and Winter</strong></p>

<p>Fall and Winter are usually good times for cleaning up garden debri and turning garden trash, leaves and other organic matter into compost. Compost can be a invaluable aid in soil preperatin as it helps replenish much needed organic matter that helps hold moisture in the soil and allows for aeration of the soil so that root plant root systems are less vulnerable to rot and fungus. Fall and Winter are also good times to prune shrubs, bushes and border plants as many of these plants go dormant during these seasons. </p>
